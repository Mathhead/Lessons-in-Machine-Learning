    "The temperature in __new_sample__ has the following effect: temperatures smaller than $1$ basically force the likelihood of unlikely characters to $0$, which results the model in predicting the most likely characters, whereas temperatures greater than $1$ result in the probability distribution of the predicted characters to be very uniform. Therefore: temperatues smaller than $1$ produce a text which appears to be quite natural, whereas high temperatures cause random mumble.<br>\n",
